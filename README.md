# Random book character picker
A little script that scrapes data from web to get data like names, personality types, body features then combinds it all together to form a "book character".

* I left the scripts that scrape the data but excluded the data files.

##  Get started
1. Get the info using the scripts to scrape the data.
2. Boom run the main script and generate some random characters for a writing challenge. 

### Notes
Pretty simple script. Not much to it, was a lot of fun to build.

Send me a message on twitter [@melockchain](https://twitter.com/melockchain) for any comments on how I can improve it or feature ideas.
